This repository contains tasks completed as part of the job simulation program offered by JPMorgan Chase & Co on the Forage website.
The tasks include analyzing a dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider.
The dataset comprises five transaction types: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER.
Additionally, the dataset includes two fields related to fraud tagging: IsFlaggedFraud indicates fraud detected by the automation system, while IsFraud denotes fraud that genuinely occurred.
Users are provided with context to explore the dataset effectively.
